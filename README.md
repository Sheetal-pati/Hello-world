This a basic and simple approach to learn html and css. Also thereis a little bit of introductory javascript.
What basically i have done here is that,
i have created a web page for online shopping(sort of departmental store) using HTML and CSS. Then i have created a login page using html and css again and have validated it using javascript that is included in the index.html file within the script tag.
